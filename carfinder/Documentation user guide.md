There are three buttons on the home page: Take quiz, Sign up, and Log in.


If you click the “Take quiz” button, you’ll enter the car quiz. When taking a quiz, it will always start from the beginning no matter what your progress was beforehand. If there are cars that match the choices you picked, they will be listed out with the make, model, year and cost. If you logged in beforehand (by clicking the “Log in” button and following the steps below), then you will have the option to add it to your favorites to look at later. You are able to go back to the previous questions if you wish to change your choice by clicking the “Back” button. At the results page, you can click the exit button to return to the homepage.


If you click the “Sign up” button, you can enter a username and password to add to the database. The requirements are that the username needs to not be empty and that the password is at least 8 characters long. If the username is already used, it will go through but the account with that password will not be changed. Successful sign ups (as in the username field is not empty and the password is 8+ characters long) will return the user to the homepage.


If you click the “Log in” button, you can enter a username and password. If that combination is in the database, you will be sent back to the homepage. Clicking on the log in page again will show the list of favorites for the user with the option to remove a favorite next to each car’s information. This removal feature is not yet implemented.


Refreshing the page will log the user out.
